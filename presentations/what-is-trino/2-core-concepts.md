## Data sources, connectors, and catalogs

* ***Data sources*** are anything from databases, REST APIs, files in object
  storage or any filesystems, and any data that can be represented in a tabular
  format
* ***Connectors*** provides a table-based abstraction over the underlying data
  source that is accessible through SQL
* ***Catalogs*** is a SQL abstraction containing details a data source, exposes
  its schemas, and configures a specific connector to use
